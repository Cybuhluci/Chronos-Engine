        // General Gameplay & Mechanics
        "Never turn your back on a Weeping Angel. Don’t blink. Don’t even blink.",
        "The shadows aren’t just empty space—some of them bite.",
        "The TARDIS doesn’t always take you where you want, but always where you need.",
        "If something seems wrong with time, it probably is.",
        "Some threats can’t be fought—only escaped.",
        "Even the most advanced technology is useless against the laws of time.",
        "Paradoxes have consequences. Don’t take them lightly.",
        "The TARDIS databank updates with each encounter. Keep checking it.",
        "If a door doesn’t open, maybe you’re not supposed to go through it... yet.",
        "Not all whispers are in your head.",

        // Mission-Specific Hints
        "Vashta Nerada infest shadows. If there are more shadows than there should be, run.",
        "If The Commander dies, the station may not be the only thing lost.",
        "Daleks never retreat—unless they fear something more.",
        "A world torn by war holds many secrets, but not all should be uncovered.",
        "A planet fighting to contain its own black hole? Some things are meant to stay buried.",
        "Echoes of the past can be helpful, or they can be hungry.",
        "If you see a statue that wasn’t there before, assume the worst.",
        "The Frozen Academy is not abandoned. Not really.",
        "Not everything in the shadows is silent. Some whisper. Some wait.",
        "The sky of the dying planet speaks. Do not listen.",
        "Time doesn’t flow properly here. Watch for things that should not be.",
        "If you think you’ve escaped the bounty hunter, think again.",
        "Some people worship 'the hills.' They may know more than they let on.",
        "Your past, present, and future might not be as separate as you think.",
        "A relentless hunter never stops. But they do make mistakes.",
        "If the bounty hunter finds their way into the TARDIS, it's already too late.",

        // Enemies & Threats
        "Daleks are relentless. If you hear 'Exterminate,' it's already too late.",
        "The Silence are easy to forget. Too easy.",
        "Weeping Angels are fast. Faster than you think.",
        "The Whisper Men won’t attack, but that doesn’t make them safe.",
        "If the Vashta Nerada are here, leave while you still can.",
        "If you hear soft tapping, don’t turn around.",
        "The Warped Colony’s timeline is broken. That means so are its people.",
        "A world dying in fire can still whisper your name.",
        "Somewhere out there, something is always watching.",
        "You are not the first traveler here. You won’t be the last.",
        "Some nightmares follow you home.",
        "Not all wounds heal. Some change you forever.",
        "Your body might survive, but will your mind?",
        "Step into the shadows, and you may never step out again.",
        "Not all statues stay still. Blink, and you’ll never see the light again.",
        "The Whisper Men don’t need to attack. Their words alone will pull you into the dark.",
        "Daleks may be ruthless, but they aren’t always the smartest in a fight.",
        "Some things are faster than light. You won’t outrun them—outthink them instead.",
        "A hunter always knows its prey. The real question is: do they already know you?",
        "Some worlds don’t follow time’s rules. A mistake in the past might be waiting for you in the future.",
        "You don’t always have to fight. Sometimes, disappearing is the best defense."
    };
